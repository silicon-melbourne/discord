1. **Treat everyone here with respect**
   - Engage with courtesy and professionalism; personal attacks, harassment, or discriminatory language of any kind are not tolerated.
   - A good rule of thumb is to behave as if you were at work.
2. **Stay on-topic**
   - Keep discussions focused and on-topic. Low-effort posts, off-topic rants, or excessive cross-posting will be removed.
   - We're quite liberal with channels-anyone can create a Special Interest Group, or you may ask a moderator about creating channels in other areas of Silicon Melbourne.
3. **No spam or unsolicited promotion**
   - Job listings (<#1377785682545872957>), events (<#1380331134935629935>), or personal projects (<#1377783720144273408>) belong in the designated channels; anything outside them requires mod approval (give them a ping <@&1378954802037264485>)
   - "Spam" also refers to overly large and repetitive messages, memes, gifs, etc.
   - No commercial solicitation. Members whose primary role is technology sales (or anyone acting on behalf of a vendor) may not pitch, prospect, or DM users for business in this server.
   - Genuine sharing is welcome. It's okay to post tools you personally use and love, including referral or discount linksâ€”provided that:
     - You give a brief, first-hand reason why it helps you.
     - You clearly label any personal referral/affiliate links.
     - You post in the designated channel if one exists and not in discussion threads or DMs without consent.
