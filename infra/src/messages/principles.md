# Guiding Principles
1. We are a community by and for those in technology. Everything related to running Silicon Melbourne will be (soon!) open source and able to have pull-requests made against it [here](https://github.com/orgs/silicon-melbourne/). (Ideally this entire discord will be in Infrastructure as Code but the IaC tooling for discord is currently lacking—help wanted!)
2. Recruiters are allowed, but must follow the rules on job postings when doing so (they must also have the appropriate role).
3. Feedback from the community is essential as we grow—please reach out to a moderator or create a post in the <#1379406806522134591> channel.
4. Eventually sponsorships or donations will be accepted, however these will only be accepted strictly be with no-strings-attached terms and will go back into supporting the community and those in it.
## A note on juniors & aspiring
Juniors or aspiring technologists are encouraged to join and connect with others in the industry through this community. Please remember to be patient and ensure you are following the rules, and that you are expecting others to do the same equally.
## IC-Focused Membership
This community is for Individual Contributors first. Members ideally have meaningful, hands-on experience as an IC (engineering, design, product, testing, analysis, etc.). Career managers or executives without recent (within the last ~7 years) IC experience are currently very welcome but we will be seeking continued feedback from the community on the presence of those in non-IC roles in Silicon Melbourne.
