# Welcome to the Silicon Melbourne community discord server
## Uniting Melbourne technology
If you're based or working in Melbourne and Victoria this is a place to connect with peers and like-minded individuals and keep your finger on the pulse of Melbourne Technology.
## Silicon Melbourne has 3 primary goals:
### 1. **Connect**: enable meaningful, low-friction, low-cost connection and networking throughout Melbourne technology
Melbourne Technology is comprised of over 90k people, and a whopping [270k people if you include the whole of Victoria](https://djsir.vic.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/2277005/Victorian-Digital-Technology-Sector-Factsheet-2023.pdf). It's significant, but sometimes it feels small. Now more than ever, the industry needs to come together.
Currently our ability to connect is monopolised by large, self-serving social media corporations like LinkedIn. [Silicon Melbourne](<https://silicon.melbourne/>) aims to change that, and create opportunity through connection.
### 2. **Support**: be a resource for a generation of aspiring people-in-technology
For some trying to enter (or re-enter) the job market the current climate has seen a number of doors close for them. As a result a number of folk are feeling hung-out-to-dry and without support. Silicon Melbourne aims to connect those at the beginning or at a challenging time of their career with the rest of the technology industry; to follow, engage with, and learn from.
### 3. **Contribute**: vouch for and give back to the community
Creating community at scale opens doors for us to be able to give back to the community. We're still figuring out what that will look like and how best to serve the community in an open and trusted way.
